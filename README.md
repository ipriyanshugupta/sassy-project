#Simple Task management App, developed using Node.js, express.js, mongoDB as database and Redis as in-memory db.
CRUD operation APIs are developed to manage Tasks.
User Registration, Login, Logout APIs are also developed.
For password saving in the database, I have used bcrypt.
For Authentication, JWT(jsonwebtoken) is used.
